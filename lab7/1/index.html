        <h1 style="font-size:5vw;">Programming Language</h1>
        <p style="font-size:2vw;">A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions
            that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement
            algorithms.</p>

    <div class="left">
        <h1 style="font-size:5vw;">C</h1>
        <p style="font-size:2vw;">C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting
            structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many
            unintended operations.</p>

    <div class="main">
        <h1 style="font-size:5vw;">Python</h1>
        <p style="font-size:2vw;">is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido
            van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
            notable use of significant whitespace.</p>

    <div class="right">
        <h1 style="font-size:5vw;">Java</h1>
        <p style="font-size:2vw;">Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent,
            class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as
            possible.</p>
